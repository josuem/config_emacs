       hunspell - format of Hunspell dictionaries and affix files

DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
       _H_u_n_s_p_e_l_l(1) Hunspell requires two files to define the way a language is
       being spell checked: a dictionary file containing words and  applicable
       flags,  and  an  affix file that specifies how these flags wil controll
       spell checking.  An optional file is the personal dictionary file.


DDiiccttiioonnaarryy ffiillee
       A dictionary file (*.dic) contains a list of words, one per line.   The
       first  line of the dictionaries (except personal dictionaries) contains
       the approximate word count (for optimal hash memory  size).  Each  word
       may  optionally  be  followed  by  a slash ("/") and one or more flags,
       which represents the word attributes, for example affixes.

       Note: Dictionary words can contain also slashes when escaped  like   ""
       syntax.


PPeerrssoonnaall ddiiccttiioonnaarryy ffiillee
       Personal  dictionaries  are  simple  word  lists. Asterisk at the first
       character position signs prohibition.  A second  word  separated  by  a
       slash sets the affixation.


              foo
              Foo/Simpson
              *bar

       In  this  example, "foo" and "Foo" are personal words, plus Foo will be
       recognized with affixes of Simpson (Foo's etc.) and bar is a  forbidden
       word.


SShhoorrtt eexxaammppllee
       Dictionary file:

              3
              hello
              try/B
              work/AB

       The flags B and A specify attributes of these words.

       Affix file:


              SET UTF-8
              TRY esianrtolcdugmphbyfvkwzESIANRTOLCDUGMPHBYFVKWZ'

              REP 2
              REP f ph

              PFX A Y 1
              PFX A 0 re .

              SFX B Y 2
              SFX B 0 ed [^y]
              SFX B y ied y

       In  the  affix  file,  prefix A and suffix B have been defined.  Flag A
       defines a `re-' prefix. Class B defines two  `-ed'  suffixes.  First  B
       suffix  can  be added to a word if the last character of the word isn't
       `y'.  Second suffix can be added to the words terminated with an `y'.


       All accepted words with this  dictionary  and  affix  combination  are:
       "hello", "try", "tried", "work", "worked", "rework", "reworked".

       Hunspell  source distribution contains more than 80 examples for option
       usage.


       SET encoding
              Set character encoding of words and morphemes in affix and  dic‐
              tionary  files.  Possible values: UTF-8, ISO8859-1 - ISO8859-10,
              ISO8859-13  -  ISO8859-15,  KOI8-R,  KOI8-U,   microsoft-cp1251,
              ISCII-DEVANAGARI.

              SET UTF-8

       FLAG value
              Set  flag type. Default type is the extended ASCII (8-bit) char‐
              acter.  `UTF-8' parameter sets UTF-8 encoded  Unicode  character
              flags.   The `long' value sets the double extended ASCII charac‐
              ter flag type, the `num' sets the decimal number flag type. Dec‐
              imal flags numbered from 1 to 65000, and in flag fields are sep‐
              arated by comma.  BUG: UTF-8 flag type doesn't work on ARM plat‐
              form.

              FLAG long

       COMPLEXPREFIXES
              Set  twofold  prefix stripping (but single suffix stripping) eg.
              for morphologically complex languages with right-to-left writing
              system.


       LANG langcode
              Set  language  code for language specific functions of Hunspell.
              Use it to activate special casing of Azeri (LANG az) and Turkish
              (LANG tr).

       IGNORE characters
              Sets  characters  to  ignore dictionary words, affixes and input
              words.  Useful for optional characters, as Arabic  (harakat)  or
              Hebrew  (niqqud) diacritical marks (see tests/ignore.* test dic‐
              tionary in Hunspell distribution).


       AF number_of_flag_vector_aliases

       AF flag_vector
              Hunspell can substitute affix flag sets with ordinal numbers  in
              affix rules (alias compression, see makealias tool). First exam‐
              ple with alias compression:

              3
              hello
              try/1
              work/2

       AF definitions in the affix file:

              AF 2
              AF A
              AF AB

       It is equivalent of the following dic file:

              3
              hello
              try/A
              work/AB

       See also tests/alias* examples of the source distribution.

       Note I: If affix file contains the FLAG parameter, define it before the
       AF definitions.

       Note II: Use makealias utility in Hunspell distribution to compress aff
       and dic files.

       AM number_of_morphological_aliases

       AM morphological_fields
              Hunspell can substitute also  morphological  data  with  ordinal
              numbers  in  affix  rules (alias compression).  See tests/alias*
              examples.

       Suggestion parameters  can  optimize  the  default  n-gram  (similarity
       search in the dictionary words based on the common 1, 2, 3, 4-character
       length common character-sequences), character swap and deletion sugges‐
       tions  of Hunspell.  REP is suggested to fix the typical and especially
       bad language specific bugs, because the REP suggestions have the  high‐
       est  priority  in the suggestion list.  PHONE is for languages with not
       pronunciation based orthography.

       KEY characters_separated_by_vertical_line_optionally
              Hunspell searches and suggests words with one different  charac‐
              ter  replaced  by a neighbor KEY character. Not neighbor charac‐
              ters in KEY string separated by vertical line characters.   Sug‐
              gested KEY parameters for QWERTY and Dvorak keyboard layouts:

              KEY qwertyuiop|asdfghjkl|zxcvbnm
              KEY pyfgcrl|aeouidhtns|qjkxbmwvz

       Using  the first QWERTY layout, Hunspell suggests "nude" and "node" for
       "*nide". A character may have more neighbors, too:

              KEY qwertzuop|yxcvbnm|qaw|say|wse|dsx|sy|edr|fdc|dx|rft|gfv|fc|tgz|hgb|gv|zhu|jhn|hb|uji|kjm|jn|iko|lkm

       TRY characters
              Hunspell can suggest right word forms, when they differ from the
              bad  input  word  by  one TRY character. The parameter of TRY is
              case sensitive.

       NOSUGGEST flag
              Words signed with NOSUGGEST flag are not  suggested  (but  still
              accepted  when  typed  correctly).  Proposed flag for vulgar and
              obscene words (see also SUBSTANDARD).

       MAXCPDSUGS num
              Set max. number of suggested compound words  generated  by  com‐
              pound  rules.  The number of the suggested compound words may be
              greater from the same 1-character distance type.

       MAXNGRAMSUGS num
              Set max. number of n-gram suggestions. Value 0 switches off  the
              n-gram suggestions (see also MAXDIFF).

       MAXDIFF [0-10]
              Set  the similarity factor for the n-gram based suggestions (5 =
              default value; 0 = fewer n-gram suggestions, but min.  1;  10  =
              MAXNGRAMSUGS n-gram suggestions).

       ONLYMAXDIFF
              Remove  all  bad n-gram suggestions (default mode keeps one, see
              MAXDIFF).

       NOSPLITSUGS
              Disable word suggestions with spaces.

       SUGSWITHDOTS
              Add dot(s) to suggestions, if input word terminates  in  dot(s).
              (Not for OpenOffice.org dictionaries, because OpenOffice.org has
              an automatic dot expansion mechanism.)

       REP number_of_replacement_definitions

       REP what replacement
              This table specifies modifications to try first.  First  REP  is
              the  header of this table and one or more REP data line are fol‐
              lowing it.  With this table,  Hunspell  can  suggest  the  right
              forms  for the typical spelling mistakes when the incorrect form
              differs by more than 1 letter from the right form.   The  search
              string supports the regex boundary signs (^ and $).  For example
              a possible English replacement table definition to  handle  mis‐
              spelled consonants:

              REP 5
              REP f ph
              REP ph f
              REP tion$ shun
              REP ^cooccurr co-occurr
              REP ^alot$ a_lot

       Note  I:  It's  very useful to define replacements for the most typical
       one-character mistakes, too: with REP you can add higher priority to  a
       subset of the TRY suggestions (suggestion list begins with the REP sug‐
       gestions).

       Note II: Suggesting separated words, specify spaces with underlines:


              REP 1
              REP onetwothree one_two_three

       Note III: Replacement table can be used for a  stricter  compound  word
       checking with the option CHECKCOMPOUNDREP.


       MAP number_of_map_definitions

       MAP string_of_related_chars_or_parenthesized_character_sequences
              We  can  define language-dependent information on characters and
              character sequences that  should  be  considered  related  (i.e.
              nearer than other chars not in the set) in the affix file (.aff)
              by a map table.  With this table, Hunspell can suggest the right
              forms  for  words,  which incorrectly choose the wrong letter or
              letter groups from a related set more than once in a  word  (see
              REP).

              For  example a possible mapping could be for the German umlauted
              Ã¼ versus the regular u; the word FrÃ¼hstÃ¼ck really  should  be
              written with umlauted u's and not regular ones

              MAP 1
              MAP uÃ¼

       Use parenthesized groups for character sequences (eg. for composed Uni‐
       code characters):

              MAP 3
              MAP Ã(ss)  (character sequence)
              MAP ï¬(fi)  ("fi" compatibility characters for Unicode fi ligature)
              MAP (Ã³Ì£)o   (composed Unicode character: Ã³ with bottom dot)

       PHONE number_of_phone_definitions

       PHONE what replacement
              PHONE uses a table-driven phonetic transcription algorithm  bor‐
              rowed from Aspell. It is useful for languages with not pronunci‐
              ation based orthography. You can add a full alphabet  conversion
              and  other rules for conversion of special letter sequences. For
              detailed documentation see  http://aspell.net/man-html/Phonetic-
              Code.html.   Note:  Multibyte  UTF-8  characters have not worked
              with bracket expression yet. Dash expression  has  signed  bytes
              and not UTF-8 characters yet.

       WARN flag
              This  flag  is for rare words, wich are also often spelling mis‐
              takes, see option -r of command line Hunspell and FORBIDWARN.

       FORBIDWARN
              Words with flag WARN aren't accepted by the spell checker  using
              this parameter.

OOPPTTIIOONNSS FFOORR CCOOMMPPOOUUNNDDIINNGG
       BREAK number_of_break_definitions

       BREAK character_or_character_sequence
              Define  new  break  points  for breaking words and checking word
              parts separately. Use ^ and $ to delete characters  at  end  and
              start  of the word. Rationale: useful for compounding with join‐
              ing character or strings (for example,  hyphen  in  English  and
              German  or hyphen and n-dash in Hungarian). Dashes are often bad
              break points for tokenization, because compounds with dashes may
              contain  not  valid parts, too.)  With BREAK, Hunspell can check
              both side of these compounds, breaking the words at  dashes  and
              n-dashes:

              BREAK 2
              BREAK -
              BREAK ----    # n-dash

       Breaking  are recursive, so foo-bar, bar-foo and foo-foo----bar-bar would
       be valid compounds.  Note: The default word break of Hunspell is equiv‐
       alent of the following BREAK definition:

              BREAK 3
              BREAK -
              BREAK ^-
              BREAK -$

       Hunspell  doesn't  accept  the  "-word" and "word-" forms by this BREAK
       definition:

              BREAK 1
              BREAK -

       Switching off the default values:

              BREAK 0

       Note II: COMPOUNDRULE is better for handling dashes and other  compound
       joining  characters  or  character  strings.  Use BREAK, if you want to
       check words with dashes or other joining characters  and  there  is  no
       time  or  possibility  to  describe  precise  compound  rules with COM‐
       POUNDRULE (COMPOUNDRULE handles only the suffixation of the  last  word
       part of a compound word).

       Note  III:  For command line spell checking of words with extra charac‐
       ters, set WORDCHARS parameters: WORDCHARS ----- (see tests/break.*) exam‐
       ple

       COMPOUNDRULE number_of_compound_definitions

       COMPOUNDRULE compound_pattern
              Define  custom  compound patterns with a regex-like syntax.  The
              first COMPOUNDRULE is a header with the number of the  following
              COMPOUNDRULE  definitions.  Compound  patterns  consist compound
              flags, parentheses, star and question mark  meta  characters.  A
              flag  followed  by  a  `*'  matches a word sequence of 0 or more
              matches of words signed with this compound flag.   A  flag  fol‐
              lowed  by  a  `?' matches a word sequence of 0 or 1 matches of a
              word signed with  this  compound  flag.   See  tests/compound*.*
              examples.

              Note:  en_US  dictionary of OpenOffice.org uses COMPOUNDRULE for
              ordinal number recognition (1st, 2nd, 11th, 12th,  22nd,  112th,
              1000122nd etc.).

              Note  II:  In the case of long and numerical flag types use only
              parenthesized flags: (1500)*(2000)?

              Note III: COMPOUNDRULE flags work completely separately from the
              compounding  mechanisme  using COMPOUNDFLAG, COMPOUNDBEGIN, etc.
              compound flags. (Use  these  flags  on  different  enhtries  for
              words).


       COMPOUNDMIN num
              Minimum  length of words used for compounding.  Default value is
              3 letters.

       COMPOUNDFLAG flag
              Words signed with COMPOUNDFLAG may be in compound words  (except
              when  word  shorter than COMPOUNDMIN). Affixes with COMPOUNDFLAG
              also permits compounding of affixed words.

       COMPOUNDBEGIN flag
              Words signed with COMPOUNDBEGIN (or with a signed affix) may  be
              first elements in compound words.

       COMPOUNDLAST flag
              Words  signed  with COMPOUNDLAST (or with a signed affix) may be
              last elements in compound words.

       COMPOUNDMIDDLE flag
              Words signed with COMPOUNDMIDDLE (or with a signed affix) may be
              middle elements in compound words.

       ONLYINCOMPOUND flag
              Suffixes  signed  with ONLYINCOMPOUND flag may be only inside of
              compounds (Fuge-elements in German, fogemorphemes  in  Swedish).
              ONLYINCOMPOUND  flag works also with words (see tests/onlyincom‐
              pound.*).  Note: also valuable to flag compounding  parts  which
              are not correct as a word by itself.

       COMPOUNDPERMITFLAG flag
              Prefixes are allowed at the beginning of compounds, suffixes are
              allowed at the end of compounds by default.  Affixes  with  COM‐
              POUNDPERMITFLAG may be inside of compounds.

       COMPOUNDFORBIDFLAG flag
              Suffixes with this flag forbid compounding of the affixed word.

       COMPOUNDROOT flag
              COMPOUNDROOT  flag signs the compounds in the dictionary (Now it
              is used only in the Hungarian language specific code).

       COMPOUNDWORDMAX number
              Set maximum word count in a compound word.  (Default  is  unlim‐
              ited.)

       CHECKCOMPOUNDDUP
              Forbid word duplication in compounds (e.g. foofoo).

       CHECKCOMPOUNDREP
              Forbid  compounding, if the (usually bad) compound word may be a
              non compound word with a REP fault. Useful  for  languages  with
              `compound friendly' orthography.

       CHECKCOMPOUNDCASE
              Forbid upper case characters at word boundaries in compounds.

       CHECKCOMPOUNDTRIPLE
              Forbid  compounding,  if compound word contains triple repeating
              letters (e.g. foo|ox or xo|oof). Bug: missing multi-byte charac‐
              ter  support in UTF-8 encoding (works only for 7-bit ASCII char‐
              acters).

       SIMPLIFIEDTRIPLE
              Allow simplified 2-letter forms of the  compounds  forbidden  by
              CHECKCOMPOUNDTRIPLE.  It's useful for Swedish and Norwegian (and
              for the old German orthography: Schiff|fahrt -> Schiffahrt).

       CHECKCOMPOUNDPATTERN number_of_checkcompoundpattern_definitions

       CHECKCOMPOUNDPATTERN endchars[/flag] beginchars[/flag] [replacement]
              Forbid compounding, if the first word in the compound ends  with
              endchars,  and next word begins with beginchars and (optionally)
              they have the requested flags.  The optional replacement parame‐
              ter allows simplified compound form.

              The  special  "endchars" pattern 0 (zero) limits the rule to the
              unmodified stems (stems and stems with zero affixes):

              CHECKCOMPOUNDPATTERN 0/x /y

       Note: COMPOUNDMIN doesn't work correctly with the compound word  alter‐
       nation, so it may need to set COMPOUNDMIN to lower value.

       FORCEUCASE flag
              Last  word  part of a compound with flag FORCEUCASE forces capi‐
              talization of the whole compound word. Eg. Dutch  word  "straat"
              (street)  with FORCEUCASE flags will allowed only in capitalized
              compound forms, according to the Dutch spelling rules for proper
              names.

       COMPOUNDSYLLABLE max_syllable vowels
              Need  for special compounding rules in Hungarian.  First parame‐
              ter is the maximum syllable number, that may be in  a  compound,
              if  words  in  compounds  are more than COMPOUNDWORDMAX.  Second
              parameter is the list of vowels (for calculating syllables).

       SFX flag cross_product number

       SFX flag stripping suffix [condition [morphological_fields...]]
              An affix is either a prefix or a suffix attached to  root  words
              to  make other words. We can define affix classes with arbitrary
              number affix rules.  Affix classes are signed with affix  flags.
              The  first  line of an affix class definition is the header. The
              fields of an affix class header:

              (0) Option name (PFX or SFX)

              (1) Flag (name of the affix class)

              (2) Cross product (permission to combine prefixes and suffixes).
              Possible values: Y (yes) or N (no)

              (3) Line count of the following rules.

              Fields of an affix rules:

              (0) Option name

              (1) Flag

              (2) stripping characters from beginning (at prefix rules) or end
              (at suffix rules) of the word

              (3) affix (optionally with flags of continuation classes,  sepa‐
              rated by a slash)

              (4) condition.

              Zero stripping or affix are indicated by zero. Zero condition is
              indicated by dot.  Condition is a  simplified,  regular  expres‐
              sion-like  pattern,  which  must  be met before the affix can be
              applied. (Dot signs an arbitrary character. Characters in braces
              sign  an  arbitrary  character  from  the character subset. Dash
              hasn't got special meaning, but circumflex (^)  next  the  first
              brace sets the complementer character set.)

              (5) Optional morphological fields separated by spaces or tabula‐
              tors.

       CIRCUMFIX flag
              Affixes signed with CIRCUMFIX flag may be on a  word  when  this
              word  also  has a prefix with CIRCUMFIX flag and vice versa (see
              circumfix.* test files in the source distribution).

       FORBIDDENWORD flag
              This flag signs forbidden word form. Because affixed  forms  are
              also  forbidden,  we  can  subtract  a  subset  from  set of the
              accepted affixed and compound words.  Note:  usefull  to  forbid
              erroneous words, generated by the compounding mechanism.

       FULLSTRIP
              With  FULLSTRIP,  affix rules can strip full words, not only one
              less characters, before adding the affixes, see fullstrip.* test
              files in the source distribution).  Note: conditions may be word
              length without FULLSTRIP, too.

       KEEPCASE flag
              Forbid uppercased and capitalized forms  of  words  signed  with
              KEEPCASE  flags.  Useful for special orthographies (measurements
              and currency often keep their  case  in  uppercased  texts)  and
              writing  systems  (e.g.  keeping  lower case of IPA characters).
              Also valuable for words erroneously written in the wrong case.

              Note: With CHECKSHARPS declaration, words with sharp s and KEEP‐
              CASE  flag  may  be  capitalized  and uppercased, but uppercased
              forms of these words may not contain sharp s, only SS. See  ger‐
              mancompounding  example  in  the tests directory of the Hunspell
              distribution.

              Deprecated. Use "st:" field instead of LEMMA_PRESENT.

       NEEDAFFIX flag
              This  flag  signs  virtual  stems  in the dictionary, words only
              valid when affixed.   Except,  if  the  dictionary  word  has  a
              homonym or a zero affix.  NEEDAFFIX works also with prefixes and
              prefix + suffix combinations (see tests/pseudoroot5.*).

       PSEUDOROOT flag
              Deprecated. (Former name of the NEEDAFFIX option.)

       SUBSTANDARD flag
              SUBSTANDARD flag signs affix rules and dictionary  words  (allo‐
              morphs)  not used in morphological generation (and in suggestion
              in the future versions). See also NOSUGGEST.

       WORDCHARS characters
              WORDCHARS extends tokenizer of Hunspell command  line  interface
              with  additional word character. For example, dot, dash, n-dash,
              numbers, percent sign are word character in Hungarian.

       CHECKSHARPS
              SS letter pair in uppercased (German) words may  be  upper  case
              sharp  s  (Ã).  Hunspell can handle this special casing with the
              CHECKSHARPS declaration (see also KEEPCASE flag  and  tests/ger‐
              mancompounding example) in both spelling and suggestion.

       Hunspell's  dictionary items and affix rules may have optional space or
       tabulator separated  morphological  description  fields,  started  with
       3-character (two letters and a colon) field IDs:


               word/flags po:noun is:nom

       Example: We define a simple resource with morphological informations, a
       derivative suffix (ds:) and a part of speech category (po:):

       Affix file:


               SFX X Y 1
               SFX X 0 able . ds:able

       Dictionary file:


               drink/X po:verb

       Test file:


               drink
               drinkable

       Test:


               $ analyze test.aff test.dic test.txt
               > drink
               analyze(drink) = po:verb
               stem(drink) = po:verb
               > drinkable
               analyze(drinkable) = po:verb ds:able
               stem(drinkable) = drinkable

       You can see in the example, that the analyzer concatenates the  morpho‐
       logical fields in _i_t_e_m _a_n_d _a_r_r_a_n_g_e_m_e_n_t style.

              Marseille ph:maarsayl

       st:    Stem. Optional: default stem is the dictionary item  in  morpho‐
              logical  analysis.  Stem field is useful for virtual stems (dic‐
              tionary words with NEEDAFFIX flag) and morphological  exceptions
              instead of new, single used morphological rules.

              mice  st:mouse is:plural
              teeth st:tooth is:plural

       Word forms with multiple stems need multiple dictionary items:


              lay po:verb st:lie is:past_2
              lay po:verb is:present
              lay po:noun

       al:    Allomorph(s).  A  dictionary item is the stem of its allomorphs.
              Morphological generation needs stem, allomorph and affix fields.

              sing al:sang al:sung
              sang st:sing
              sung st:sing

       po:    Part of speech category.

       ds:    Derivational suffix(es).  Stemming doesn't  remove  derivational
              suffixes.   Morphological generation depends on the order of the
              suffix fields.

              In affix rules:


              SFX Y Y 1
              SFX Y 0 ly . ds:ly_adj

       In the dictionary:


              ably st:able ds:ly_adj
              able al:ably

       is:    Inflectional suffix(es).  All inflectional suffixes are  removed
              by  stemming.   Morphological generation depends on the order of
              the suffix fields.


              feet st:foot is:plural

       ts:    Terminal suffix(es).  Terminal suffix  fields  are  inflectional
              suffix fields "removed" by additional (not terminal) suffixes.

              Useful  for  zero  morphemes  and  affixes  removed by splitting
              rules.


              work/D ts:present

              SFX D Y 2

              SFX D   0 ed . is:past_2

       Typical example of the terminal suffix is the zero morpheme of the nom‐
       inative case.


       sp:    Surface  prefix.  Temporary  solution for adding prefixes to the
              stems and generated word forms. See tests/morph.* example.


       pa:    Parts of the compound  words.  Output  fields  of  morphological
              analysis for stemming.

       Ispell's  original algorithm strips only one suffix. Hunspell can strip
       another one yet (or a plus prefix in COMPLEXPREFIXES mode).

       The twofold suffix stripping is a significant improvement  in  handling
       of  immense  number  of  suffixes, that characterize agglutinative lan‐
       guages.

       A second `s' suffix (affix class Y) will be the continuation  class  of
       the suffix `able' in the following example:


               SFX Y Y 1
               SFX Y 0 s .

               SFX X Y 1
               SFX X 0 able/Y .

               drinkable
               drinkables

       Test:


               $ hunspell -m -d test <test.txt
               drink st:drink
               drinkable st:drink fl:X
               drinkables st:drink fl:X fl:Y

       Theoretically  with  the twofold suffix stripping needs only the square
       root of the number of suffix rules, compared with a Hunspell  implemen‐
       tation. In our practice, we could have elaborated the Hungarian inflec‐
       tional morphology with twofold suffix stripping.

       Hunspell can handle more than 65000 affix classes.  There are three new
       syntax for giving flags in affix and dictionary files.

       _F_L_A_G _l_o_n_g command sets 2-character flags:


                FLAG long

                foo/Y1Z3F?

       _F_L_A_G _n_u_m command sets numerical flags separated by comma:

                SFX 65000 Y 1
                SFX 65000 0 s 1

       Dictionary example:

       The third one is the Unicode character flags.

       An interesting side-effect of multi-step stripping is, that the  appro‐
       priate  treatment  of circumfixes now comes for free.  For instance, in
       Hungarian, superlatives are formed by simultaneous prefixation of  _l_e_g_-
       and  suffixation of _-_b_b to the adjective base.  A problem with the one-
       level architecture is that there is no way to render lexical  licensing
       of  particular  prefixes  and  suffixes  interdependent,  and therefore
       incorrect forms are recognized as valid, i.e. *_l_e_g_v_Ã_©_n  =  _l_e_g  +  _v_Ã_©_n
       `old'.  Until  the introduction of clusters, a special treatment of the
       superlative had to be hardwired in the earlier HHuunnSSppeellll code. This  may
       have  been  legitimate  for  a  single case, but in fact prefix--suffix
       dependences are ubiquitous in category-changing  derivational  patterns
       (cf.  English  _p_a_y_a_b_l_e, _n_o_n_-_p_a_y_a_b_l_e but _*_n_o_n_-_p_a_y or _d_r_i_n_k_a_b_l_e, _u_n_d_r_i_n_k_‐
       _a_b_l_e but _*_u_n_d_r_i_n_k). In simple words, here, the prefix _u_n_- is legitimate
       only  if  the  base _d_r_i_n_k is suffixed with _-_a_b_l_e. If both these patters
       are handled by on-line affix rules and affix rules are checked  against
       the  base only, there is no way to express this dependency and the sys‐
       tem will necessarily over- or undergenerate.

       In next example, suffix class R have got a prefix `continuation'  class
       (class P).

       Conditional  affixes implemented by a continuation class are not enough

       also need CIRCUMFIX option for correct morphological analysis.

       Allowing  free compounding yields decrease in precision of recognition,
       not to mention stemming and morphological analysis.   Although  lexical
       switches are introduced to license compounding of bases by IIssppeellll, this
       proves not to be restrictive enough. For example:


              # affix file
              COMPOUNDFLAG X

              2
              foo/X
              bar/X

       With this resource, _f_o_o_b_a_r and _b_a_r_f_o_o also are accepted words.

       This has been improved upon with the introduction  of  direction-sensi‐
       tive compounding, i.e., lexical features can specify separately whether
       a base can occur as leftmost or  rightmost  constituent  in  compounds.
       This,  however,  is still insufficient to handle the intricate patterns
       of compounding, not to mention idiosyncratic  (and  language  specific)
       norms of hyphenation.

       The  HHuunnssppeellll  algorithm  currently  allows  any affixed form of words,
       which are lexically marked as potential members of compounds.  HHuunnssppeellll
       improved  this, and its recursive compound checking rules makes it pos‐
       sible to implement the intricate spelling conventions of Hungarian com‐
       pounds. For example, using COMPOUNDWORDMAX, COMPOUNDSYLLABLE, COMPOUND‐
       ROOT, SYLLABLENUM options can be set  the  noteworthy  Hungarian  `6-3'
       rule.   Further  example  in  Hungarian, derivate suffixes often modify
       compounding properties. Hunspell allows the compounding  flags  on  the
       affixes,  and there are two special flags (COMPOUNDPERMITFLAG and (COM‐
       POUNDFORBIDFLAG) to permit or prohibit compounding of the derivations.

       Suffixes with this flag forbid compounding of the affixed word.

       We also need several Hunspell features for handling German compounding:

       This solution is still not ideal, however, and will be  replaced  by  a
       pattern-based  compound-checking  algorithm which is closely integrated
       with input buffer tokenization. Patterns describing compounds come as a
       separate input resource that can refer to high-level properties of con‐
       stituent parts (e.g. the number of syllables, affix flags, and contain‐
       ment  of hyphens). The patterns are matched against potential segmenta‐
       tions of compounds to assess wellformedness.

       Both IIssppeellll and MMyyssppeellll use 8-bit ASCII character encoding, which is  a
       major  deficiency  when  it  comes to scalability.  Although a language
       like Hungarian has a standard ASCII  character  set  (ISO  8859-2),  it
       fails  to allow a full implementation of Hungarian orthographic conven‐
       tions.  For instance, the '--' symbol (n-dash)  is  missing  from  this
       character  set  contrary  to  the fact that it is not only the official
       symbol to delimit parenthetic clauses in the language, but it can be in
       compound words as a special 'big' hyphen.

       MySpell  has  got  some  8-bit encoding tables, but there are languages
       without standard 8-bit encoding, too. For example,  a  lot  of  African
       languages have non-latin or extended latin characters.

       Similarly,  using  the  original spelling of certain foreign names like
       _Ã_n_g_s_t_r_Ã_¶_m or _M_o_l_i_Ã_¨_r_e is encouraged by  the  Hungarian  spelling  norm,
       and,  since  characters  'Ã'  and 'Ã¨' are not part of ISO 8859-2, when
       they combine with inflections containing characters only in  ISO 8859-2
       (like  elative _-_b_Å_l, allative _-_t_Å_l or delative _-_r_Å_l with double acute),
       these result in words (like _Ã_n_g_s_t_r_Ã_¶_m_r_Å_l or _M_o_l_i_Ã_¨_r_e_-_t_Å_l_.) that can not
       be encoded using any single ASCII encoding scheme.

       The  problems raised in relation to 8-bit ASCII encoding have long been
       recognized by proponents of Unicode. It is  clear  that  trading  effi‐
       ciency  for  encoding-independence  has  its advantages when it comes a
       truly multi-lingual application. There is implemented a memory and time
       efficient  Unicode  handling in Hunspell. In non-UTF-8 character encod‐
       ings Hunspell works with the original 8-bit strings. In UTF-8 encoding,
       affixes  and words are stored in UTF-8, during the analysis are handled
       in mostly UTF-8, under condition checking and suggestion are  converted
       to  UTF-16.  Unicode  text  analysis  and spell checking have a minimal
       (0-20%) time overhead and minimal or reasonable memory overhead depends
       from the language (its UTF-8 encoding and affixation).

       Aspell  dictionaries  can be easily converted into hunspell. Conversion
       steps:

       cat xx.wl >> xx.dic

       aaffffiixx ffiillee

       If the affix file exists, copy it:
       cp xx_affix.dat xx.aff
       If not, create it with the suitable character encoding (see xx.dat)
       echo "SET ISO8859-x" > xx.aff
       or
       echo "SET UTF-8" > xx.aff

       It's useful to add a TRY option with the characters of  the  dictionary
       with frequency order to set edit distance suggestions:
       echo "TRY qwertzuiopasdfghjklyxcvbnmQWERTZUIOPASDFGHJKLYXCVBNM" >>xx.aff
